[mod-setting-description]
italics-closestfirst-search_area_setting=The area that is scanned to find constructable/deconstructable entities. Only distances within this area is calculated, when everything has been built or deconstructed inside this area, use base Factorio method. - A high value will lead to lag
italics-closestfirst-update_rate_setting=Probably fine to leave at 60+ unless you want to test performance. Set it to 2, if you notice any performance degradation, reduce search range and finally set it back to 60. Set to 0 to disable updates.
italics-closestfirst-limit_area_setting=Limit roboports to this range, useful to avoid construction bots spending energy flying very far away when having many roboports - No performance impact
